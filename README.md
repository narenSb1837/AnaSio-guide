# AI-Powered Multimodal Anatomy Learning Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered, multimodal chatbot designed to assist medical students in learning anatomy. By leveraging the "Anatomy and Physiology Vol 1 to 3" textbooks, the chatbot can answer questions and retrieve relevant text, images, and tables, enhancing the overall learning experience.

## Features

- **Text Retrieval**: Provides accurate and contextually appropriate textual content from the textbooks in response to user queries.
- **Image and Table Retrieval**: Fetches relevant images and tables from the textbooks to enhance the depth and clarity of responses.
- **Probing Questions**: The chatbot asks clarifying questions when it is uncertain about a query, ensuring better understanding before providing an answer.
- **Latency Optimization**: Designed to minimize response time, delivering answers quickly and efficiently to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Project Phases

### Phase I: Initial Setup and Core Functionality
